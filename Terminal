- D or Control ⌃-D to advance half a page - B or Control ⌃-B to go back one page - U or Control ⌃-U to go back half a page

What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used. A flag adds additional functionality to an existing command, we have seen -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands
What do the r and f flags do with the rm command? r will remove folders and recursively go through each folder and file and f will force removal
